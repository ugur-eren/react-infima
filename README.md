# React Infima

React Infima provides React components for the Infima styling framework. It doesn't add any new features to Infima, it just ports the components to React.

### Both React Infima and Infima is not yet ready for production use.

## Why use React Infima?

In most cases you shouldn't. React Infima is going to receive breaking changes unannounced and not going to follow semver rules until the first stable version of Infima. Infima has very easy and basic usage and React Infima is not adding any new features to it. But I believe both Infima and React Infima is going to be very helpful in the near future.

## Quick Start

Install the React Infima and Infima using your favorite package manager.

npm:

```bash
npm install --save infima react-infima
```

yarn:

And start using the components of Infima by importing it from React Infima.
