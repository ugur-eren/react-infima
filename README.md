## Why use React Infima?

In most cases you shouldn't. React Infima is going to receive breaking changes unannounced and not going to follow semver rules until the first stable version of Infima. Infima has very easy and basic usage and React Infima is not adding any new features to it. But I believe both Infima and React Infima is going to be very helpful in the near future.
